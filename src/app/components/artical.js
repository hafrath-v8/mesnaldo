        Messi vs Ronaldo: Career Stats, Goals, Assists, and Legacy Compared
      </h1>

      {/* Intro */}
      <p className="mb-4">
        Few debates in football history have sparked as much passion as{" "}
        <span className="text-amber-400 font-semibold">Messi vs Ronaldo</span>. 
        For over 15 years, Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo have dominated 
        world football, breaking records, collecting trophies, and dazzling fans 
        with unforgettable performances. While the world continues to debate 
        who is the “GOAT,” the truth is that their rivalry has elevated the 
        sport to unprecedented levels. This article provides a detailed 
        comparison of their{" "}
        <span className="text-amber-400 font-semibold">
          goals, assists, appearances, trophies, and legacy
        </span>
      </p>

      {/* Goals & Assists */}
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-white mt-8 mb-3">
        Goals and Assists
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Goals are the most celebrated statistic in football, and both Messi and
        Ronaldo have delivered them in abundance. Ronaldo has scored{" "}
        <span className="text-amber-400 font-semibold">820+ career goals</span>{" "}
        (excluding Saudi stats), while Messi has netted{" "}
        <span className="text-amber-400 font-semibold">790+ goals</span> 
        (excluding MLS). Their consistency in front of goal is unmatched, with 
        both maintaining elite conversion rates throughout their careers.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        But football is not only about scoring. Creativity is equally important,
        and this is where Messi has the edge with{" "}
        <span className="text-amber-400 font-semibold">330+ assists</span>, 
        compared to Ronaldo’s{" "}
        <span className="text-amber-400 font-semibold">230+ assists</span>. 
        Still, Ronaldo’s movement, aerial dominance, and ability to score in any 
        situation make him a complete forward, while Messi’s vision, passing 
        range, and dribbling artistry make him a playmaker and scorer in one.
      </p>

      {/* Appearances */}
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-white mt-8 mb-3">
        Appearances and Longevity
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Longevity is another key factor when comparing legends. Cristiano
        Ronaldo has played more than{" "}
        <span className="text-amber-400 font-semibold">1,000 professional matches</span>, 
        showing unmatched durability and fitness levels. Messi, slightly younger,
        has featured in over{" "}
        <span className="text-amber-400 font-semibold">950 matches</span> 
        and continues to perform at the top level. Their ability to remain 
        relevant for nearly two decades in an ever-evolving game is a testament 
        to their dedication and professionalism.

      {/* Trophies */}
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-white mt-8 mb-3">

      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Both players have trophy cabinets that most professionals can only dream
        of. Messi has won{" "}
        <span className="text-amber-400 font-semibold">
          multiple UEFA Champions League titles, La Liga trophies, Copa América, 
          and the FIFA World Cup
        </span>. Ronaldo has also lifted{" "}

          multiple Champions Leagues, Premier League titles, La Liga crowns, 
          Serie A silverware, and the UEFA European Championship

      <p className="mb-4">
        Their team achievements highlight their adaptability across different
        leagues and international stages, proving that both can thrive under

      {/* Individual Awards */}
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-white mt-8 mb-3">
        Ballon d’Ors and Individual Records
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Messi and Ronaldo have shared the{" "}
        <span className="text-amber-400 font-semibold">Ballon d’Or</span> 
        for more than a decade, with Messi winning the award{" "}
        <span className="text-amber-400 font-semibold">8 times</span> and 
        Ronaldo <span className="text-amber-400 font-semibold">5 times</span>. 
        Beyond that, they have earned countless Golden Boots, UEFA Best Player 
        awards, and league MVP honors. Individually, both have shattered 
        records: Messi holds the record for{" "}
        <span className="text-amber-400 font-semibold">
          most goals in a calendar year (91)
        </span>, while Ronaldo is the all-time{" "}

      {/* Playing Styles */}
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-white mt-8 mb-3">
        Different Styles, Equal Impact
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Ronaldo is the ultimate athlete: explosive pace, aerial dominance, and a
        clinical finisher with both feet. Messi, on the other hand, is a genius
        with the ball: his dribbling, vision, and ability to create something
        from nothing have left fans and defenders speechless for years.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        These contrasting approaches have fueled the debate, but they also show
        that greatness can take many forms. One is not necessarily better than
        the other—it depends on what qualities fans value most in football.

        Champions League night, every international tournament felt bigger 
        because one eye was always on Messi and Ronaldo. They not only pushed 
        each other to improve but also inspired an entire generation of 
        footballers and fans worldwide.

  His relentless pursuit of goals is highlighted by his record of scoring{" "}
  <span className="text-amber-400 font-semibold">50+ goals in a calendar year seven times</span>. 
  Messi, while known for his playmaking, is not far behind in this department, also 
  surpassing the <span className="text-amber-400 font-semibold">800-goal</span> mark and 
  holding the unique record for the most goals in a single calendar year ({" "}
  <span className="text-amber-400 font-semibold">91 goals in 2012</span>).

  achievement was leading Argentina to victory in the{" "}

  game-changing performances in the latter stages of the competition.

      <p className="mb-4">
        The debate of Messi vs Ronaldo will likely never end. Both have
        legitimate claims to being the best ever, and both have shaped football
        history in unique ways. Instead of choosing one, perhaps the better
